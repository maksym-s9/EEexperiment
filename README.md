# EEexperiment

Use Jupyter notebook with all of the files and both datasets in the same directory in order to properly access them. I had my image dataset in my desktop folder so that's where the image dataset code is routed to. Change if needed. The text dataset was in the default directory, so there's no changes needed there unless you change its location.

    - For this dataset, you need to manually delete all folders other than "happy" and "sad" in both the "train" and "test" folders.
